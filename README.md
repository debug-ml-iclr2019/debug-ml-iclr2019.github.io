# Overview
Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed to make highly consequential decisions pertaining to employment, bail, parole, and lending. While such models can learn from large amounts of data and are often very scalable, their applicability is limited by certain safety challenges. A key challenge is identifying and correcting systematic patterns of mistakes made by ML models before deploying them in the real world.

The goal of this workshop, held at the [2019 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)](https://iclr.cc/), is to bring together researchers and practitioners with different perspectives on debugging ML models. Topics of interest are listed below.

### Topics
- Debugging via **interpretability**: How can interpretable models and techniques aid us in effectively debugging ML models?

- **Program verification** as a tool for model debugging: Are existing program verification frameworks readily applicable to ML models? If not, what are the gaps that exist and how do we bridge them?

- **Visualization** tools for debugging ML models: What kind of visualization techniques would be most effective in exposing vulnerabilities of ML models?

- **Human-in-the-loop** techniques for model debugging: What are some of the effective strategies for using human input and expertise for debugging ML models?

- Novel **adversarial** attacks for highlighting errors in model behavior: How do we design adversarial attacks that highlight vulnerabilities in the functionality of ML models?

- **Theoretical correctness** of model debugging techniques: How do we provide guarantees on the correctness of proposed debugging approaches? Can we take cues from statistical considerations such as multiple testing and uncertainty to ensure that debugging methodologies and tools actually detect ‘true’ errors?

- Theoretical guarantees on the **robustness** of ML models: Given a ML model or system, how do we bound the probability of its failures?

- Insights into **errors or biases of real-world ML systems**: What can we learn from the failures of widely deployed ML systems? What can we say about debugging for different types of biases, including discrimination? 

- **Best practices** for debugging large-scale ML systems: What are standardized best practices for debugging large-scale ML systems? What are existing tools, software, and hardware, and how might they be improved? 

- **Domain-specific nuances** of debugging ML models in healthcare, criminal justice, public policy, education, and other social good applications.
