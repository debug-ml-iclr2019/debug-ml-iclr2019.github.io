# Overview
Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly being employed to make highly consequential decisions pertaining to employment, bail, parole, and lending. While such models can learn from large amounts of data and are often very scalable, their applicability is limited by certain safety challenges. A key challenge is identifying and correcting systematic patterns of mistakes made by ML models before deploying them in the real world.

The goal of this workshop, held at the [2019 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)](https://iclr.cc/), is to bring together researchers and practitioners with different perspectives on debugging ML models.

## Call for Talks and Demos for Debugging-in-Practice Track
For this Debugging-in-Practice track, we solicit work that advances the understanding of issues related to **debugging ML models in practice**. Submissions from industry practitioners are encouraged. Accepted submissions will be presented as **talks or interactive demos**. An award will be given to the best submission in this track.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 

- **Success and failure stories** from deploying ML models in the real world

- **Software and hardware tools** for model debugging -- demos of tools are welcome and highly encouraged

- Understanding the **domain-specific** nuances of debugging ML models - e.g., debugging ML models in healthcare, criminal justice, public policy, education, and other social good applications

- Best practices for **debugging large-scale ML systems in industry**

### Important Dates
- **Submission deadline**: April 1, 2019, 11.59pm Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time
- **Acceptance notification**: April 12, 2019 (before ICLR registration cancellation deadline)
- **Camera-ready deadline for accepted extended abstracts**: April 25, 2019
- **Workshop**: Monday May 6th 09:00 AM â€“ 06:00 PM @ Room R3

If you need a visa to travel to the US, consider submitting your work before the submission deadline. Then contact us so that we can fast track reviewing of your work. If you need more time to prepare your submission, please contact us early on and we will see what we can do.

### Submission Instructions
- Submission page: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debugml19](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debugml19)
- In EasyChair, you will be asked to select if you would like to present your work, if accepted, as a talk (7-15 minutes) during a Debugging-in-Practice session at the workshop, or as an interactive demo during a Posters & Demos session, or both.
- Submit extended abstracts of 1 page (not including references, and an optional appendix) using any template with minimum 11 point font and page margins of at least 1 inch. The 1-page limit is strict, but references and optional appendix (e.g. for screenshots, video links, etc.) can be as many pages as needed. As reviewers may not read the optional appendix, the extended abstract should standalone. 
- If you intend to present your work as a demo, we strongly encourage you to provide screenshots of the demo in the optional appendix. 
- The reviewing process is not blind, hence you do not need to anonymize your submission. Links to software implementations need not be anonymized. 
- Concurrent submission to other venues is allowed. Work already published or made public in some form will also be considered. 

**An award will be given to the best submission in this track**. Camera-ready versions of extended abstracts will be uploaded to the conference website (unless requested not to), but there will be no formal published proceedings.

Please email [debugging.ml@gmail.com](mailto:debugging.ml@gmail.com) any questions.

## Call for Research Papers (deadline has passed)
### See Call for Talks and Demos for Debugging-in-Practice Track at the top of this page
Topics of interest are listed below, although we also welcome submissions that do not directly fit into these topics.

### Topics
- Debugging via **interpretability**: How can interpretable models and techniques aid us in effectively debugging ML models?

- **Program verification** as a tool for model debugging: Are existing program verification frameworks readily applicable to ML models? If not, what are the gaps that exist and how do we bridge them?

- **Visualization** tools for debugging ML models: What kind of visualization techniques would be most effective in exposing vulnerabilities of ML models?

- **Human-in-the-loop** techniques for model debugging: What are some of the effective strategies for using human input and expertise for debugging ML models?

- Novel **adversarial** attacks for highlighting errors in model behavior: How do we design adversarial attacks that highlight vulnerabilities in the functionality of ML models?

- **Theoretical correctness** of model debugging techniques: How do we provide guarantees on the correctness of proposed debugging approaches? Can we take cues from statistical considerations such as multiple testing and uncertainty to ensure that debugging methodologies and tools actually detect â€˜trueâ€™ errors?

- Theoretical guarantees on the **robustness** of ML models: Given a ML model or system, how do we bound the probability of its failures?

- Insights into **errors or biases of real-world ML systems**: What can we learn from the failures of widely deployed ML systems? What can we say about debugging for different types of biases, including discrimination? 

- **Best practices** for debugging large-scale ML systems: What are standardized best practices for debugging large-scale ML systems? What are existing tools, software, and hardware, and how might they be improved? 

### Important Dates
- **Submission deadline**: ~~March 1, 2019, 11.59pm~~. March 2, 2019, 11.59pm Pacific Time. If you miss the deadline, email us your submission at debugging.ml@gmail.com and we will consider it on a case-to-case basis.
- **Acceptance notification**: March 18, 2019 (before ICLR early registration deadline)
- **Camera-ready submission period** for accepted papers: April 14 - 20, 2019
- **Workshop**: Monday May 6th 09:00 AM -- 06:00 PM @ Room R3

If you are a student or postdoc, we encourage you to apply for ICLRâ€™s [volunteer](https://iclr.cc/accounts/login/?next=/Volunteers/volunteerapplication) and [travel grants](https://iclr.cc/accounts/login/?next=/TravelApplication) before their March 13 deadline. If you need a visa to travel to the US, consider submitting your paper before the submission deadline. Then contact us so that we can fast track reviewing of your paper. 

### Submission Instructions
- Submission page: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debugml19](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=debugml19)

- Submit anonymized papers of up to 4 pages (not including references, and an optional appendix) using the [ICLR template](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019/CallForPapers). The 4 page limit is strict, but references and optional appendix can be as many pages as needed. As reviewers may not read the optional appendix, it should be used sparingly for technical proofs and/or reproducibility (e.g. code, experiment details). 

- The reviewing process is double blind. Hence, please ensure that the PDF does not contain any information that could identify authors or institutions. Do not put author names or institutions in the filename of the PDF. 

- Concurrent submission to other venues (journal, conference workshop) is allowed. Work already published in a journal,conference, or workshop should be extended in a meaningful way. 

Accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop. Additionally, some accepted papers will also be invited to present spotlight or oral talks at the workshop. Selected papers will be recognized with **Best Research Paper**, **Best Applied Paper**, **Best Student Paper** awards. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be uploaded to the conference website (unless requested not to), but there will be no formal published proceedings.
